# a low-pass filter cut-off of h_freq = 40 Hz
# and possibly a high-pass filter cut-off of l_freq = 1 Hz
# so you would preserve only the power in the 1Hz to 40 Hz band.
# Note that highpass filtering is not necessarily recommended as it can
# distort waveforms of evoked components, or simply wash out any low
# frequency that can may contain brain signal. It can also act as
# a replacement for baseline correction in Epochs. See below.
#
# If you use this pipeline for time-frequency analysis, a default filtering
# could be a high-pass filter cut-off of l_freq = 1 Hz
# a low-pass filter cut-off of h_freq = 120 Hz

# MNE conducts ICA as a sort of a two-step procedure: First, a PCA is run
# on the data (trying to exclude zero-valued components in rank-deficient
# data); and in the second step, the principal components are passed

# components to pass to ICA – it can be all or just a subset. This determines
# how many independent components to fit, and can be controlled via this
# setting.

# If int, specifies the number of principal components that are passed to the
# ICA algorithm, which will be the number of independent components to
# fit. It must not be greater than the rank of your data (which is typically
# the number of channels, but may be less in some cases).

# If float between 0 and 1, all principal components with cumulative
# explained variance less than the value specified here will be passed to
# ICA.

# If `None` (default), `0.999999` will be used to avoid issues when working with

# If `None` (default), do not apply artifact rejection.

# If a dictionary, manually specify rejection thresholds (see examples).
# The thresholds provided here must be at least as stringent as those in
# [`ica_reject`][mne_bids_pipeline._config.ica_reject] if using ICA. In case of
# `'autoreject_global'`, thresholds for any channel that do not meet this
# requirement will be automatically replaced with those used in `ica_reject`.

# If `"autoreject_global"`, use [`autoreject`](https://autoreject.github.io) to find
# suitable "global" rejection thresholds for each channel type, i.e., `autoreject`
# will generate a dictionary with (hopefully!) optimal thresholds for each
# channel type.
